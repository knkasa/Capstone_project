	<p>  Here, the decision tree is used to identify
		which variable has the most impact in making customers 
		exit.  Below is the tree chart  for the current 
		dataset.  </p>

	After the tree chart is constructed, one can estimate
	 the impact power for  each of the variables by summing
	 changes in the mean squared error and dividing the 
	 sum by the number of branch nodes.  Below shows the 
	 normalized impact power for the decision tree and
	 compared to the regression model.

	<p>
	It can be seen that two different models yielded different
	conclusions.  Both models concluded &quot;Age&quot; has
	the most impact while the regression predicted
	&quot;Active Member&quot; to be the 2nd most impactful variable
	; on the other hand, the decision tree 
	predicted &quot;Number of product&quot; to be the 2nd most
	impactful variable.  A proper analysis is often needed to 
	determine which model is most suited for the particular
	dataset.  In this case, the regression model did not predict
	&quot;Number of product&quot; has higher impact than other
	variables.
