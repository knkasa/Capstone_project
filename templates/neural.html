	<p> 
	For the neural network, Levenbergâ€“Marquardt function 
	and 2 layers with 10 neuralns are used for 
	the training.  The confusion matrix for the regression/neural network is 
	shown below. Overall, the neural network performed slightly
	better.  The prediction ratio (a ratio the model correctly
	predicted) is <b>80.7%</b> for the reggresion and 
	<b>86.9%</b> for the neural network.  The neural network
	assumed 12.8% of customers would exit the bank whereas 
	the regression model assumed only 3.9% would exit the bank.  The 
	The actual percentage that customers left the bank is 20.4%.
	So, both models were underpredicting; particulary the 
	regression model was shy in predicting the exited customers.
	Another word, regression model
	predicts most customers would stay in the bank.

	<p>  
	The regression model let users easily see which variables
	have the biggest impact. This can
	be done by simply comparing its coefficients in the fitting 
	function. However, the neural network has no such coefficients since
	there is no fitting function to begin with.  For the 
	neural network, we determine such variables by comparing
	the change in  <i>R</i> value.  Below is the list of variables
	that are found to be important.
 	</p>
	
	
	<ol  class="center"  >
		<li>Age</li>
		<li><b>Number of product</b></li>
		<li>Active member</li>
		<li>Germany</li>
		<li>Gender</li>
		<li>Balance</li>
		<li>Credit score</li>
	</ol> 
	
	
	<p>
	We see the biggest change in <i>R</i> value when we 
	include/exclude &quot;Age&quot; in the model indicating 
	Age plays an important role, the  same conclusion arrived in the 
	regression model.  The difference is the current neural
	network includes &quot;Number of product&quot; as the 
	second biggest factor where as the regression model did not include
	this variable.  We tested the regression model again
	with &quot;Number of product&quot; included, though it 
	did not improve the result showing its non-linear behavior 
	that regession model could not fit.
